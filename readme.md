## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/about-screenshot.png)

Astral is currently the best VSRG that's been written in Python. On top of this, Astral is also open sourced here on GitHub.

Astral is in its early-development stage at the moment, so bugs and missing/broken features should be expected. Knowing this, anyone is welcome to help with development.

*P.S: This project is made in my free time so development may be inactive or slow at times.*
